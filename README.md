Get a GRIP on your next group trip!

GRIP was created to help plan and organize upcoming trips with friends! Users are able to keep track of trip details, tasks that each group member need to complete, and an expense tracker to keep track of who spent what. GRIP was created because after the past year it's time to travel again, and we are looking forward to help your group organize their next trip. 

The application utilizies graphQL on the backend to keep track of all the trip data, and any updates and changes to the trip, tasks or expenses. On the frontend the application runs on react and creates a streamlined and seemless UI, to create an easy user experience. The application is currently deployed on a heroku server and is full compatible on mobile devices, so users can use the application anywhere.
