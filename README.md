Get a GRIP on your next group trip!

GRIP was created to help plan and organize upcoming trips with friends! Users are able to keep track of trip details, tasks that each group member needs to complete, and an expense tracker to keep track of the trip budget.

GRIP runs on React and uses Material UI components. All login information is stored with the authorization protocol, OAuth. The application utilizes MongoDB, GraphQL, and Apollo to keep track of and access all the trip data. Every form implement Formik, using Yup for validation. GRIP is currently deployed on a digital ocean server and is fully compatible on mobile devices, so users can access the application anywhere.

\*Note: This version of code was forked from the original at [Korbin-Sargent/vacation-planning-app](https://github.com/Korbin-Sargent/vacation-planning-app). As an original contributor, [Audrey Gillies](https://github.com/audrey-g37) refactored the first version and hosted it on a different server post employment experience.

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->

## Getting Started

To get started with GRIP, please visit the [deployed application](https://grip.webappsbyaudreyapi.dev/).

## Usage

Users are asked to create an account with an email and password. They will use that information to login and view any trip information. The user is able to create a new trip and view/edit existing trips. Each trip is associated with tasks and expenses to help users track what needs to be done and the money that has been spent on the trip. Tasks and budget items can be created and edited as well.
